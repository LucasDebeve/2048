# 2048 Game

This is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 game in JavaScript.

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. You can use the arrow keys to slide the tiles. Each time you slide the tiles, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 will appear on the board.

If two tiles with the same number collide while sliding, they will merge into a single tile with the sum of their values. For example, if you slide two tiles with a value of 2 together, they will merge into a single tile with a value of 4.

The game is over when the board is completely filled with tiles and there are no more possible moves.

## Getting Started

To run the game, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. There are no additional dependencies or libraries required.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the game by modifying the `style.css` file. You can also adjust the game settings, such as the board size and starting tile values, by modifying the constants at the top of the `script.js` file.
